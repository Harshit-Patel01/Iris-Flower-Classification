# Iris Flower Classification
This is a Iris- FLower-Classification MSE-I by Harshit Singh Patel

A machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into different species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Overview

This project uses the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation 
- Visualization of results
- Making predictions on new data

## Features

- KNN classification model
- Data visualization including:
  - Pairplot of feature relationships
  - Correlation matrix heatmap
  - Confusion matrix
  - K-value optimization plot
- Interactive prediction function
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics

## Dataset

The dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width  
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Model Performance

The KNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying iris flowers. Key metrics include:
- Classification accuracy
- Detailed classification report
- Confusion matrix visualization
